# Repository Guidelines

- Employ object-oriented design and keep each class/module focused on a single responsibility.
- Logic modules should not exceed 350 lines of code; GUI modules may extend to 500 lines.
- Target an average of roughly 300 lines per file across the codebase.
- Adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach by writing or updating tests before implementing features or fixes.
- Run `pytest` and execute `python harvester.py` when modifying code to ensure functionality.
- Avoid committing generated files (e.g., logs, `__pycache__`).
